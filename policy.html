                <li><b>Code of Conduct</b><br>
                We ask everyone to be respectful, friendly, and welcoming to others. Treating people
                badly, making fun of others, or being mean is not allowed (light joking and playful
                teasing are okay if everyone is okay with it). If someone breaks these rules, they
                may get a warning, be temporarily banned, or asked to leave the group.
                </li>

                <li><b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
                We collect and store only necessary member information (such as name,
                email, and shared content) to improve your club experience. This data 
                is kept secure and will not be shared outside the club. You may request 
                data deletion at any time.
                </li>

                <li><b>Activity Pariticipation</b><br>
                All members are welcome to join our regular programs, outings, and special events. 
                For offsite activities (gaming or fiction conventions, field trips), safety 
                guidelines and event rules must be followed. Club leaders are responsible for event 
                organization and member well-being.
                </li>

                <li><b>Moderation & Disciplinary Actions</b><br>
                Issues and complaints are handled by club moderators. Investigations 
                are fair, and disciplinary actions are issued according to the severity 
                of the violation.
                </li>

                <li><b>Intellectual Property</b><br>
                Content created by the club, including reviews and creative works, 
                is owned by the club unless otherwise credited. Members must respect 
                copyright and fair use when sharing or reproducing materials.
                </li>

                <li><b>Policy Updates</b><br>
                These policies may be updated as needed. Notifications of any changes 
                will be sent to members through official club channels.
